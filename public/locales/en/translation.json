    "description": "Nabta was not a coincidence… but a dream that grew from science and blossomed in the embrace of nature.\n\nIt was founded by Nihal Basyouni, an Egyptian clinical pharmacist, after more than 3 years of research, planning, and decision-making. She was not only seeking to launch a new product but to build an effective, luxurious feminine therapeutic experience — reflecting a deeper vision of true beauty.\n\nShe was joined on this journey by Dr. Abdullah Al-Qursh, the Egyptian doctor who believed with her that care is not a luxury… but a right every woman deserves when it is presented scientifically, with details that pulse with love.\n\nThus, NABTAH was born — a brand carrying a promise in its heart:\nThat care can make you feel powerful, pampered with elegance, and deliver results that truly resemble you.\n\nIn every product, you will find:\nA pure formula designed by a specialized medical team,\nAn unforgettable soft texture,\nA scent that resembles your favorite moment,\nAnd packaging that opens a small door to luxury.\n\nBecause at Nabta, we don’t sell a product.\nWe grant you a care journey you deserve in every detail.\nNabta… from you, to you.",
